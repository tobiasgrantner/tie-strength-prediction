# Prediction of tie strength in social networks

In this project, we aim to predict the tie strength between two users in a social network.
We use a dataset containing information about interactions between users on the website of
the Austrian newspaper Der Standard in May 2019. We are working on this project as a part
of the course Social Network Analysis at the Technical University of Vienna.

All files for the submission can be found within the folder [submision](submission)
folder.
Additionally, the file `interaction-final.csv` can be found in this [G-Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G9Z5Jv0lIHEU37RubHLU7pWd4nnrYccu/view?usp=sharing) because it is too large to add it to the Repo.
It needs to be added to the [graph](submission/graph) folder.
