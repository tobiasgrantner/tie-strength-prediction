# Prediction of tie strength in social networks

In this project, we aim to predict the tie strength between two users in a social network. We use a dataset containing information about interactions between users on the website of the Austrian newspaper [Der Standard](https://derstandard.at/) in May 2019. We are working on this project as a part of the course [Social Network Analysis](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/educationDetails.xhtml?semester=2023W&courseNr=194050) at the Technical University of Vienna.
